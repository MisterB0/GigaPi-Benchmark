# GigaPi-Benchmark
Benchmark that calculates Pi with modern UI and easy use.

One little project of mine. I first saw superpi in an LTT video and downloaded it just for fun. I started it and after opening i thought: What does all that mean? Instead to watch a Youtube Tuturial i decided to whip up a quick prototype. 
Appx. one month after that i discovered the project again and thought about adding an UI using TKInter next. After that i showed it my dad and then tried to make it to an .exe using  pyinstaller wich worked great. Today i uploaded this version using the babel libary to add 
multiple languages. Here we are.

**HOW TO INSTALL**

1. Download the latest release as an .exe or .tar.gz
2. On Windows you can easyly open the file and on Linux you need to first unpack the .tar.gz and then run the included file as an program


I use arch btw.
Have fun.
